# Verifications

## Problematic

In most projects, if not all, we need to define some input validations. Also, sometimes, we want to express some invariants in our models.

There is a lot of means to define these validations. Here some cases in different languages that could be found in projects:

```scala
def nonEmptyString(value: String): Validated[String] = {
  if (value.nonEmpty) {
    Valid(value)
  } else {
    Invalid("The string should not be empty")
  }
}
```

```typescript
// If you do not know TypeScript, consider it as JavaScript with types only.
function isNonEmptyString(value: string): boolean {
  return value !== undefined && value !== null && value !== ''
}
```

```php
function validateNonEmptyString(String $value) {
  if ($value == null || empty($value)) {
    throw new InvalidArgumentException("The string should not be empty");
  }
}
```

```java
class NonEmptyStringVerification extends Verification<String> {
  public String getErrorMessage() {
    return "The string should not be empty";
  }

  public boolean validate(String value) {
    return value != null && !value.isEmpty();
  }
}
```

Each previous variant do the same thing: validating that a string is non empty \(with language specific features sometimes\). We usually have the same thing as input \(the string value to validate\) but several output types \(Validation type, boolean, exceptions, â€¦\) and they are structured in different ways \(functions or classes\).

How could we see that all these codes are validations? Here some tips:

* The function or class name contains terms like `verification` or `validate`
* The return type is `boolean` or `Validated`
* There is exceptions returned
* The code structure is a simple condition or a simple `if/else` statement with a return value for each branch

ðŸ¤” Seems like there is a code pattern. Could we introduce a language feature?

## Verification syntax

### Literal message

**Definiti** defines a syntax for verification functions:

```text
verification NonEmptyString {
  "The string should not be empty"
  (value: String) => {
    string.nonEmpty()
  }
}
```

That's all. We use the same pattern that other languages but give it a specific syntax. When compiling into other languages, it will be the role of the compiler to use the specific technical structure in your language.

Here, we use a hard-coded message but you can use a code \(eg: `error.non.empty.string`\) for your translation system too.

### Typed message

Literal messages are good for generic messages but how can you add information in your messages? **Definiti** provides a syntax for that:

```text
verification PositiveNumber {
  // Declare a message with the code "positive.number" and a parameter of type Number
  // For instance, the message could be "The number '{0}' is negative"
  message("positive.number", Number)
  (value: Number) => {
    if (value >= 0) {
      ok
    } else {
      ko(value)
    }
  }
}
```

Now, your message can have more information. You can give has many parameters as you want. The `ok` instruction does not accept any parameter \(the value is valid, that's all\) but `ko` instruction requires as many parameters as the message \(except the message code\) and in the declared types.

You can see that the first parameter is a message code and not the message itself. To enforce the usage of a internationalization system, **Definiti** does no string interpolation for verifications.

Message parameter types can be any type, native or project types. The responsibility of converting them into strings is not managed by **Definiti**. Also, it ensures you to give the right type and right number of types.

### Code parameters

Some verifications can also accept parameters to be more generic. For instance, to declare a verification checking that a number is between a specific range, you can do:

```text
verification IsBetween(min: Number, max: Number) {
  // Message sample: The value should be between {min} and {max}.
  message("is.between", Number, Number)
  (value: Number) => {
    if (min <= value && value <= max) {
      ok
    } else {
      ko(min, max)
    }
  }
}
```

The parameters `min` and `max` are defined for the verification and can be used inside the function. You can use them in the condition as well as the `ko` instruction. It is just parameters like any other.

### Generics

If you need to declare a generic in your verification, you can use following syntax:

```text
verification NonEmptyList {
  "The list should not be empty"
  [A](value: List[A]) => {
    value.nonEmpty()
  }
}
```

## Usage

You can use the verification as follow:

```text
// Some verifications declared anywhere
verification IsNonEmptyString {
  "Please give a string"
  (value: String) => {â€¦}
}
verification MaxLengthOf200 {
  "You cannot give more than 200 characters"
  (value: String) => {â€¦}
}
verification IsBetween(min: Number, max: Number) {
  message("is.between", Number, Number)
  (value: Number) => {â€¦}
}
// Project types are also accepted!
verification IsPersonComplete {
  "The person should be complete"
  (value: Person) => {â€¦}
}

// Defined type
// For a Person to be valid, it also need to respect verification IsPersonComplete
type Person verifying IsPersonComplete {
  // When empty, gives the message "Please give a string"
  // When length > 200, gives the message "You cannot give more than 200 characters"
  firstName: String verifying IsNonEmptyString verifying MaxLengthOf200
  
  // When erroneous, gives the message "Please give a last name" because explicited here
  lastName: String verifying IsNonEmptyString("Please give a last name")
  
  // When erroneous, gives the message message("is.between", 18, 150)
  age: Number verifying IsBetween(18, 150)
  
  // When erroneous, gives the message "Hmmâ€¦ Are you sure?" (with no parameter)
  numberOfSibling: Number verifying IsBetween(1, 20, "Hmmâ€¦ Are you sure?")
}

// Alias type
type NonEmptyString = String verifying IsNonEmptyString
```
